# ebay-sdk-php8

# Installation (This is for Development)
- But I do use it for my business as if in production
### Add this to your root composer.json file in your Laravel or other PHP framework
```
"repositories": [
        
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "https://github.com/CreateWithCoding/ebay-sdk-php8"
        }
],
```
### Run this within your Laravel Project from the command line
```
composer require createwithcoding/ebay-sdk-php8

```
- Contact me if you are having difficulties getting this to work in your project.
- I utilize this code to integrate into the eBay Shopping API, the past 4 years to run part of my business.
- Code has been improved over the years.
- It works with Laravel 8 & PHP 8.
- It allows latest Guzzle 7 to be installed into your project via Composer.
- This also works with the eBay OAUTH2 requirement: "Note: Developers using Shopping API calls must authenticate with an OAuth application access token in the HTTP header X-EBAY-API-IAF-TOKEN and use OAuth application access tokens with a scope that includes https://api.ebay.com/oauth/api_scope"
Reference: https://developer.ebay.com/devzone/shopping/docs/concepts/shoppingapiguide.html
- I've included my Laravel code within this eBay SDK to retrieve the token from my database. The code is within the file CredentialsProvider.php. Feel free to fork this and modify as you please, or contact me for some guidance. I am not encrypting the token as it only lasts 2 hours. And it's just for the Shopping API.

*******************************************
I've got other projects I'm working on. So this is just a "fix" to keep one part of my business running smoothly with the eBay Shopping API.

- Later I'll learn how to create the Shopping API SDK and other eBay SDK from autogenerated API's.
