Forked From David T Sadler ebay-sdk-php

I use this for the Shopping API the past 4 years. I'm in process of making it work with Laravel 8 & PHP 8.
I've got other projects I'm working on. So this is just a "fix" to keep one part of my business running smoothly with the Shopping API from this.
Later I'll be creating the Shopping API SDK and any other eBay SDK

"Believe and Act as If It were Impossible to Fail"
"Believe YOU can and You're Halfway There"

Health is Indeed Wealth. The balance of programming for me is:
Kitesurf, Gym, Hike, Bike, Bodysurf, Garden, Calisthenics, Relax the eyes towards 20/20 vision, rest in hammock, Fasting with water/juice.
Seek an everlasting high EQ (Emotional Quotient). Be kind to others.
